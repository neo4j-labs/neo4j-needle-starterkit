|===

The ConnectionModal component is a React component designed to handle the connection setup to a Neo4j database. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering database connection details and displays feedback on the connection attempt. This component is particularly useful in applications requiring a dynamic connection to a Neo4j database.

== Pre-requisite

- Ensure you have the `@neo4j-ndl` library installed in your project to use this `ConnectionModal` component.
- Ensure you also import the utils/Driver.tsx as it is used for creating the driver connection to the Neo4j Database.

== Usage

To integrate the ConnectionModal component into your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the component:

[source,jsx]
----
import ConnectionModal from './path/to/ConnectionModal';
----

2. Add state to your parent component to control the modal's visibility and to handle the connection status:

[source,jsx]
----
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState(false);
----

3. Render the `ConnectionModal` component with the required props:

[source,jsx]
----
<ConnectionModal
  open={isModalOpen}
  setOpenConnection={setIsModalOpen}
  setConnectionStatus={setConnectionStatus}
  message={{ type: 'info', content: 'Please enter your database connection details.' }}
/>
----

== Component Props

The ConnectionModal component accepts the following props:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Required

| `open`
| A boolean state indicating whether the modal is open or closed.
| Yes
| `setOpenConnection`
| A function to update the `open` state above.
| Yes
| `setConnectionStatus`
| A function to update the parent component's connection status based on the success or failure of the connection attempt.
| Yes
| `message?`
| An optional `Message` object containing a `type` for styling the banner (success, info, warning, danger, neutral) and a `content` string for the message text.
| No
|===

`(Optionnal)` Message object structure:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  type: string; // success | info | warning | danger | neutral
  content: string; // The message content
}
----

== Key components

=== Handling State

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage local state for each connection parameter (protocol, hostname, port, etc.) and the connection message to provide feedback.

=== Submitting the Connection Details

Upon submitting the form:

1. It constructs the connection URI using the selected protocol, hostname, and port.
2. It calls `setDriver` to attempt the database connection.
3. Based on the success or failure of `setDriver`, it updates the connection status and potentially closes the modal or displays an error message.
