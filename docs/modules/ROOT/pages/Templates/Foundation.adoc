=== Layout Architecture

The template structure is centered around the `Home.tsx` component, which incorporates the `Header` and `PageLayout` components. `PageLayout` further divides the page into `SideNav` and `Content` sections, offering a comprehensive environment for application development.

The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

=== Code Snippets

.Here is a snippet for the auto-connect feature in `Content.tsx`

[source,tsx]
----
useEffect(() => {
  if (!init) {
    let session = localStorage.getItem('needleStarterKit-neo4j.connection');
    if (session) {
      let neo4jConnection = JSON.parse(session);
      setDriver(neo4jConnection.uri, neo4jConnection.user, neo4jConnection.password)
        .then((isSuccessful: boolean) => {
          setConnectionStatus(isSuccessful);
        });
    }
    setInit(true);
  }
});

.This snippet showcases the side navigation bar setup in `SideNav.tsx`

[source,tsx]
----
<SideNavigation iconMenu={true} expanded={expanded} {...expandedChangeProp}>
  <SideNavigation.List>
    <SideNavigation.Item
      href='#'
      selected={selected === 'search'}
      onClick={handleClick('search')}
      icon={<MagnifyingGlassIconOutline className={fullSizeClasses} />}
    >
      Search
    </SideNavigation.Item>
    // Additional navigation items...
  </SideNavigation.List>
</SideNavigation>

=== Integration with Neo4j

The StarterKit is designed to seamlessly integrate with Neo4j databases, facilitating easy connectivity and interaction with Neo4j. The `ConnectionModal` component enables users to connect to or disconnect from their Neo4j instances, providing error feedback on the connection status if it does not succeed to connect.

.Connection Modal Usage:

[source,tsx]
----
<ConnectionModal
  open={openConnection}
  setOpenConnection={setOpenConnection}
  setConnectionStatus={setConnectionStatus}
/>
