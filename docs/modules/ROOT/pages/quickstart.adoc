# Quickstart

If you want to try it without installing it locally, you can access https://development.needle-starterkit.graphapp.io[our self-hosted] version.

Alternatively, if you want to run it locally or within your self-managed environment, please follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites
Running the StarterKit requires you to have **node.js** and **yarn** installed.

If you do not have these installed:

1. https://nodejs.org/en/download[Install node.js] for your operating system. The node installation will include `npm`. 
2. Use `npm` to install `yarn` as described https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/[here]. 


## Install & Run
Download the latest version of the starter kit from the https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neo4j-needle-starterkit[Github Repository]:


```shell
git clone git@github.com:neo4j-labs/neo4j-needle-starterkit.git
```

Navigate to the folder you just cloned and run the following commands to install and run the development server:

```shell
cd neo4j-needle-starterkit
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

If all is successful, you will be shown the following message:

```shell
  VITE v4.5.1  ready in 125 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

## Next steps
After you have the StarterKit app up-and-running, you can explore the different templates and components (see the relevant section for further details and documentation) or implement your own custom components, templates and logic.
