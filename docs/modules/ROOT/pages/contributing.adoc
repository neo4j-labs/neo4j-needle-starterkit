# Contributing

Contributions to the project are highly welcomed.
If you extend the starter kit with your own (reusable) templates/components, consider creating a Pull Request. Ensure you start from the latest release branch, and set the merge base to this branch as well.

For your feature to be accepted, ensure:

- There is a matching https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neo4j-needle-starterkit/issues[issue] on GitHub.
- Your code is formatted and linted correctly. (See `yarn run lint`).
- The template/component is well documented in the documentation portal (if applicable).
